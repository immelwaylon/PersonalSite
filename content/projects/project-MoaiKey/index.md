## Extended Summary
The original files I used were a [high poly moai stone model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:144668), a [low poly moai stone model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:908062), and a generic keycap model I found. I combined all of them in tinkercad by hollowing out the moai and placing the keycap stem in the middle. I had to adjust tolerances, scale things, and reshape everything a few times to get 3d prints of the file to fit correctly on a standard keyboard. The final product is [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hOMm323wbmz-moaimoyai-head-keycap), with a few versions that work on different types of keyboards.
