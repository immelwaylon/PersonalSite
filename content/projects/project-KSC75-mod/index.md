## Extended summary
The original files I used were a [mount for KSC75 2-pin mod](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6786806) and a [snap in mount for mmcx mod](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5031517). I merged these two because the former was designed to be screwed in, and I didn't have access to screws at the time. I didn't use the latter because I have heard bad things about the mmcx connector. After merging the models to optomize the characteristics I wanted, I made modifications to the design that would make soldering and mounting the 2-pin connector possible. Without these modifications, the connector was able to slide through completely, meaning the whole modification would implode if too much force was applied. After that, I modified everything fit correctly and made tweaks to better allow the ear clip from the original headphones to pivot. Finally, I printed the design and soldered it together. The soldering was the hardest part since the connectors had very small solder pads. The final 3D file can be found [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eUHoCDDXJ5D-snap-in-2-pin-ksc-75-mod).
